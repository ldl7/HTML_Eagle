            Advanced Weaponry: The F-15 is equipped with a diverse array of weapons including
             air-to-air missiles like the AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9 Sidewinder, 
            as well as air-to-ground munitions such as JDAMs and AGM-88 HARM missiles, 
            enabling it to engage both aerial and ground targets with precision.

            Cutting-Edge Radar Systems: The F-15 features sophisticated radar systems such as 
            the AN/APG-63(V)3 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, 
            offering enhanced detection and tracking capabilities, improved reliability, 
            and reduced vulnerability to electronic countermeasures
            
            Electronic Warfare Suites: Equipped with advanced electronic warfare suites like 
            the AN/ALQ-131 and AN/ALQ-135, the F-15 can detect, jam, and counter 
            enemy radar and communication systems, enhancing its survivability in hostile environments.
    
            Stealth Features: Although not designed as a stealth aircraft, the F-15 has undergone
            upgrades to incorporate stealth features such as radar-absorbent 
            materials and reduced radar cross-section enhancements, improving its survivability 
            against radar detection.

            Countermeasures and Defensive Systems: The F-15 is equipped with a variety of 
            countermeasures and defensive systems, including chaff and flare dispensers,
            radar warning receivers (RWRs), and electronic warfare (EW) systems, to detect and 
            evade incoming threats such as missiles and enemy aircraft.
